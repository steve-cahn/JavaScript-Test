<h1>JavaScript Test</h1>

<h2>Designing</h2>

Thinking of a design for the test was driving me crazy. I was just not coming up with anything.
I decided to try out Adobe XD, which I just so happened to install a couple days prior to starting this project. Being that I know the other adobe programs, learning adobe XD wasn't difficult at all. In fact, I didn't spend anytime fiddling around. I went straight into creating the project.

It took about two hours to finish creating the prototype in Adobe XD. That included choosing the color scheme and the font. Way faster than I expected!

<h2>Developing</h2>
Developing the web app took longer than expected. (Which project didn't? :wink:) This was my first react application. It was a lot of fun, and I'm never going back to plain old JavaScript. (Well, never is a strong word, but I clearly dislike vanila JavaScript.) Components just makes so much more sense and makes the code and project neater and clearer.

<h2>What is JavaScript Test?</h2>
As the name suggests is a test for JavaScript. Yes, there are plenty of websites that offer questions and answers for JavaScript, but that's the exact problem. There are <strong>plenty</strong> of sources without a single source of ([For react devs:] truth) content. This was created so that no one has to go fishing all over google for tests.

JavaScript Test introduces a modern, clean, and user friendly interface which is really easy and fun to use.

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Do you really understand JavaScript, or do you just copy and paste code from stackoverflow?</li>
    <li>Are you going to, or preparing for, a job interview and don't know what to expect?</li>
    <li>Or do you have a good understaning of JavaScript but just want to have some fun and prove to your friends how much you know?</li>
</ul>

If you answered YES to any of these questions, then you should <strong><a href="https://steve-cahn.github.io/Javascript-test/">Take this test</a></strong>!

<h2>Contributing</h2>
Want to be part of the JavaScript Test comunity? This is a really easy project to contribute to. Probably the easiest. Just head over to: and
add a question. It can be something you just learned today, a question you had, or you can even make up a question based on the knowlege you know. This is the source for all of JavaScript Questions.

<h3>Why Contribute</h3>
We were/all are in this position some time or another. You're trying to find JavaScript questions, for whatever reason, to test your knowledge, prepare for a job interview, or even just to have fun. Did it ever cross your mind that there should be one single source for all the JavaScript questions? Well, here it is, and we rely on people like you to contribute, so that we can expand the amount of questions there are in this test.

<h3>Rules for Contributing Questions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure the question you're posting is not a duplicate.</li>
    <li>The question has to be on JavaScript only.</li>
    <li>There has to be between 2-4 answers. Not more, and not less.</li>
</ul>
